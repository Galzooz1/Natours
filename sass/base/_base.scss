    using default font-size for each element as 66% of the initial value font-size
    which is 16px. that means the default value now for our project is equals 10px.
    when we use rem for the rest of the elements it implements directly by the root
    specification of the font-size.
    so for now every 1rem = 10px;
    and if we want to change all website font-size for user reasons,
    all we need to change is the font-size % of our root element.
    Which also help us maintain scalable code and improve responsive design!
